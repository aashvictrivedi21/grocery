**1. Install Node.js:**

Head over to the official Node.js website ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

**2. Open your project directory:**

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Node.js project resides.

**3. Install dependencies:**

Most Node.js projects have dependencies listed in a file called `package.json`. You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will download and install all the necessary packages required by your project.

**4. Start your application:**

Many Node.js projects have a starting script defined in their `package.json` file. You can typically run this script using the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start your application and you should see some output in your terminal indicating that it's running.
